\section{Initial plan}
The goal of our project was to verify security and correctness properties for home automation systems. We wanted to design and implement an abstract architecture for modelling smart systems, specify certain types of security and correctness policies for them and verify them. 

\section{Current state}
Currently, we have implemented a prototype of the proposed architecture and three case studies and have one simulation working. We implemented the broadcast mechanism of the sensors as an observer pattern where the controllers are observers and the dependency sensors are subjects. The sensors are made to generate random outputs in appropriate ranges and this is used to trigger the controllers to send commands to the dumb devices. The security and correctness properties are written in separate policy files in xml format.
