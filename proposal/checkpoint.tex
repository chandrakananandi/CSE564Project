\section{Initial plan}
The goal of our project was to verify security and correctness properties for home automation systems. In our proposal, we already explained why this is an important step for including smart home systems into our everyday lifes. The violation of security in smart home system could have severe consequences for its inhabitants. 

Our plan included building our own home automation platform after finding that most existing platforms are closed-source. We decided to focus on three types of devices, namely controllers, sensors, and dumb devices. For example, a sensor would be a thermometer and a dumb device would be a room heater. The controller would then take the sensor's data and depending on that turn the room heater on or off. For our project, we checked the security at the level of these devices and were not concerned with details like their communication protocols. 

Besides the smart home system, we have defined three types of security and correctness policies. According to our proposed timeline, algorithms for these policies need to be defined in order to verify if our system satisfies these properties. Overall, we wanted to design and implement an abstract architecture for modelling smart systems, specify certain types of security and correctness policies for them and verify them. 


\section{Current state}
Currently, we have implemented a prototype of the proposed architecture and three case studies and have one simulation working. We implemented the broadcast mechanism of the sensors as an observer pattern where the controllers are observers and the dependency sensors are subjects. The sensors are made to generate random outputs in appropriate ranges and this is used to trigger the controllers to send commands to the dumb devices. The security and correctness properties are written in separate policy files in xml format.
