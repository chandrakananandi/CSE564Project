@Inproceedings {jung,
abstract     = {<p>Although connected devices and smart homes are now marketed to average
                consumers, little is known about how access-control systems for these devices
                fare in the real world. In this paper, we conduct three case studies that
                evaluate the extent to which commercial smart devices provide affordances related
                to access control. In particular, we examine an Internet-connected lighting
                system, bathroom scale, and door lock. We find that each device has its own
                siloed access-control system and that each approach fails to provide seemingly
                essential affordances. Furthermore, no system fully supports user understanding
                of access control for the home. We discuss future directions for usable access
                control in the home.</p>},

@inproceedings {homeos,
abstract     = {<p>We argue that heterogeneity is hindering technological innovation in the
                home---homes differ in terms their devices and how those devices are connected
                and used.  To abstract these differences, we propose to develop a home-wide
                operating system. A HomeOS can simplify application development and let users
                easily add functionality by installing new devices or applications.  The
                development of such an OS is an inherently inter-disciplinary exercise. Not only
                must the abstractions meet the usual goals of being efficient and easy to program
                against, but the underlying primitives must also match how users want to manage
                and secure their home.  We describe the preliminary design of HomeOS and our
                experience with developing applications for it.</p>},
